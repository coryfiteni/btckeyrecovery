A private key is a cryptographic key that's used to sign transactions and provide access to your Bitcoin wallet. It's essentially the key to your digital treasure chest. Without your private key, you lose control over your Bitcoin holdings. This security mechanism ensures that only the owner of the private key can access and transfer their funds
